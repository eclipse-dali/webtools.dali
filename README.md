Thanks for your interest in this project. Check the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for information on that.

## Project description

The Eclipse Dali Java Persistence Tools Project, a sub-project of the Web Tools Platform Project, provides extensible frameworks and tools for the definition and editing of Object-Relational (O/R) mappings for Java Persistence API (JPA) entities. JPA mapping support focuses on minimizing the complexity of mapping by providing entity generation wizards, design-time validation, and a rich UI for entity and persistence unit configuration.
