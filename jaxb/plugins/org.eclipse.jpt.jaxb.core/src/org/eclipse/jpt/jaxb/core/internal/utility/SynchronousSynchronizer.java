 * synchronization and any nested (recursive) synchronizations are complete.
 * In some situations this implementation should be used sparingly, and for as
 * short a time as possible, as it increases the probability of deadlocks. A
 * deadlock can occur when {@link Synchronizer#synchronize()} is called from multiple
 * threads and multiple resources are locked by the synchronization in varying
 * orders.
 * <p>
 * As defined in the {@link Synchronizer} interface, {@link Synchronizer#start()}
 * and {@link Synchronizer#stop()}
 * should be called in the same thread, but it is not required.
 * {@link Synchronizer#synchronize()} should
 * always be called in the same thread (i.e. only recursively, beyond the
 * initial call); although, this too is not required.
 * This thread need not be the same thread that executes
 * {@link Synchronizer#start()} and {@link Synchronizer#stop()}.
